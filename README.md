# COURSERA-PYTHON-PROJECT-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE
This are projects that am doing at the end of each course in my Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
They entail:
### Extracting Stock Data Using Python Library.
### Extracting Stock Data Using Webscraping
### Determing the Market Price of a house using given Features
The skills gained in this project entail
1. Analysing python data using a dataset
2. Applying exploratory Data Analysis on my dataset. This composed of Descriptive Statistics, GroupBy, Correlation
3. Model Development -Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Pipelines
4. Using R^2 and Mean Squared Error measures to Perform In-Sample evaluations to numerically evaluate the Model
5. Prediction and Decision Making when determining if the model is correct
6. Model Evaluation and Refinement
7. Function -train_test_split
8. Cross Validation
9. Overfitting. Underfitting and Model Selection
10. Ridge Regression
11. Grid Search
<p>
Using the function boxplot in the seaborn library to determine whether houses with a waterfront view or without a waterfront view have more price outliers.</p>
